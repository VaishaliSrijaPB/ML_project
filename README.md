**PROJECT NAME**:Boston House Price Prediction
**ABSTRACT**:
      The prediction of Boston house prices is a vital application of machine learning and data analytics, which aims to estimate the market value of residential properties in the Boston area. This involves utilizing various algorithms and statistical techniques to analyze a dataset that includes features such as the number of rooms, property age, distance to employment centers, and socio-economic factors. By training models on this historical data, one can develop predictive models that provide accurate and reliable price estimates. This process aids stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, in making informed decisions, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and transparent housing market.
